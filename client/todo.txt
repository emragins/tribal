Interface:
Must:
Mouse functionality
	-don't know
	-idea of trying to add mouse everything to each class that wants it doesn't seem right
	
Maybe:
Window class
	-would be inherited by message boxes, menus, pretty character portraits, etc.
	-would be movable by user
	-would have pretty 'X's for closing (also closed by 'esc')
		-could be removed by inheriting class

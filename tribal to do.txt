X -password should be ****
X -make login actually work



-move the server address entirely to a file


-resizable text box
	you should be able to expand/shrink the chat box
-TEXT SCROLLING
-but the borders are off 
	and textbar burries rest
-you need a scroll bar too come to think of it
-I uh... need to add wrap around, too

-not closable chat window (don't do that, you can't get it back... and it'll probably 		crash the game)
	-hmm... maybe instead of closing chat window I'll just have it so x hides it
	-because otherwise bad shit happens

[18:28] <sal> I guess no movement, but something easy like esc deselects 
[18:29] <SDHawk> you really need to add that enter to talk



X - untested - 
[18:16] <SDHawk> when I hit enter after logging in a gain
[18:17] <SDHawk> it tried to login again
[18:17] <SDHawk> even though the login window was closed
[18:18] <sal> I don't know why.. shouldn't have.... unless.... stuff dies, but dying doesn't deselect



[17:27] <SDHawk> overall good work so far
